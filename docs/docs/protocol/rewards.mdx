description: How rewards are calculated and distributed in Safenet
---

## Overview

Safenet rewards validators and delegators for securing the network on a per-epoch basis. Rewards are designed to be stake-weighted and resistant to centralization.

#### Time-weighted stake
- Rewards are calculated using the **average staked balance over the epoch**, not a single snapshot.
- For both validators and delegators, stake is treated as a **time-weighted average** of the balance held during the reward period.

#### Stake-weighted rewards with centralization caps
- Rewards grow **linearly with total stake** up to a threshold **T**.
- Above **T**, rewards grow **sub-linearly** (proportional to $\sqrt{x}$), reducing incentives for oversized validators.
- The threshold is defined as:
    - **T = (total network stake) / (number of active validators)**

#### Participation-based eligibility
- Validator rewards are adjusted by participation.
- Validators with participation below **75%** during an epoch earn **no rewards** for that period.

#### Validator commission
- Validators charge a **20% commission** on rewards generated by delegated stake.
- **80%** of delegated rewards are distributed to delegators.
- **20%** is retained by the validator, in addition to rewards earned on their own stake.

#### Minimum payout threshold
- Rewards are only paid out if the recipient is entitled to at least **1 SAFE token** for the epoch.
- This prevents economically inefficient micro-payouts.
- Any unpaid rewards are **carried forward** and added to the reward pool of the **next epoch**.

## Calculation

This section provides a precise mathematical definition of Safenet’s reward mechanism.
All stake values are time-averaged over the reward period (epoch).

### Glossary

#### Sets and participants

- $V$ - set of active validators  
- $N = |V|$ - number of active validators  

#### Stake

- $\bar s_i$ - average SAFE tokens self-staked by validator $i$ over the epoch  
- $\bar d_{j,i}$ - average SAFE tokens delegated by delegator $j$ to validator $i$  
- $\bar d_i = \sum_j \bar d_{j,i}$ - total average delegated stake to validator $i$  
- $\bar S_i = \bar s_i + \bar d_i$ - total average stake backing validator $i$  
- $\bar S_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i \in V} \bar S_i$ - total average stake in the network  

#### Participation

- $p_i \in [0,1]$ - participation rate of validator $i$ during the epoch  
- $p_{\min} = 0.75$ - minimum participation threshold required to earn rewards  

#### Rewards

- $\Delta t$ - duration of the reward period (epoch)  
- $R$ - total reward pool distributed in the epoch  
- $R_i$ - reward allocated to validator $i$ before commission  
- $R_i^{\text{self}}$ - portion of $R_i$ attributable to validator self-stake  
- $R_i^{\text{del}}$ - portion of $R_i$ attributable to delegated stake  
- $R_i^{\text{validator}}$ - total reward earned by validator $i$ before minimum payout filtering  
- $R_i^{\text{delegators}}$ - total reward allocated to delegators of validator $i$  
- $R_{j,i}$ - reward allocated to delegator $j$ for delegation to validator $i$  

#### Incentive parameters

- $T$ - stake threshold where linear rewards stop  
- $c = 0.20$ - validator commission rate on delegated rewards  
- $m = 1$ - minimum payout threshold (in SAFE tokens)  

#### Weights

- $w(\bar S_i)$ - stake-based reward weight for validator $i$  
- $\tilde w_i$ - effective reward weight after participation filtering  

#### Payouts

- $P_i$ - raw reward payout allocated to validator $i$ **before applying the minimum payout rule**
- $P_{j,i}$ - raw reward payout allocated to delegator $j$ **before applying the minimum payout rule**
- $\hat P_i$ - final reward payout transferred to validator $i$ **after applying the minimum payout rule**
- $\hat P_{j,i}$ - final reward payout transferred to delegator $j$ **after applying the minimum payout rule**
- $R_{\text{paid}}$ - total rewards paid out in the epoch  
- $R_{\text{unpaid}}$ - rewards not paid out and carried forward  

### Time-averaged stake

For any stake balance $x(t)$ over the epoch interval $[t_0, t_1]$ with $\Delta t = t_1 - t_0$, the time-average is defined as:

$$
\bar x = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{t_0}^{t_1} x(t)\, dt
$$

### Stake threshold

The linear reward threshold is defined as the average stake per validator:

$$
T = \frac{\bar S_{\text{total}}}{N}
$$

### Stake weighting function

Rewards grow linearly up to $T$ and sub-linearly beyond $T$:

$$
w(\bar S_i) =
\begin{cases}
\bar S_i, & \text{if } \bar S_i \le T \\
T + \sqrt{\bar S_i - T}, & \text{if } \bar S_i > T
\end{cases}
$$

This penalizes oversized validators and incentivizes delegation toward smaller validators.

### Participation filter

Validators below the participation threshold receive no rewards:

$$
\tilde w_i =
\begin{cases}
p_i \cdot w(\bar S_i), & \text{if } p_i \ge p_{\min} \\
0, & \text{if } p_i < p_{\min}
\end{cases}
$$

### Reward allocation across validators

Total effective weight:

$$
W = \sum_{k \in V} \tilde w_k
$$

Validator $i$’s reward allocation:

$$
R_i = R \cdot \frac{\tilde w_i}{W}
$$

### Split between validator and delegators

#### Attribution by stake source

Reward attributable to validator self-stake:

$$
R_i^{\text{self}} = R_i \cdot \frac{\bar s_i}{\bar S_i}
$$

Reward attributable to delegated stake:

$$
R_i^{\text{del}} = R_i \cdot \frac{\bar d_i}{\bar S_i}
$$

#### Commission split

Validator earnings:

$$
R_i^{\text{validator}} = R_i^{\text{self}} + c \cdot R_i^{\text{del}}
$$

Delegator earnings (collectively):

$$
R_i^{\text{delegators}} = (1 - c) \cdot R_i^{\text{del}}
$$

### Per-delegator reward

For delegator $j$ delegating $\bar d_{j,i}$ to validator $i$:

$$
R_{j,i} = R_i^{\text{delegators}} \cdot \frac{\bar d_{j,i}}{\bar d_i}
$$

### Minimum payout rule

Raw payouts:

$$
P_i = R_i^{\text{validator}}
$$

$$
P_{j,i} = R_{j,i}
$$

### Final validator payout

$$
\hat P_i =
\begin{cases}
P_i, & \text{if } P_i \ge m \\
0, & \text{if } P_i < m
\end{cases}
$$

### Final delegator payout

$$
\hat P_{j,i} =
\begin{cases}
P_{j,i}, & \text{if } P_{j,i} \ge m \\
0, & \text{if } P_{j,i} < m
\end{cases}
$$

### Unpaid rewards

Total rewards paid out:

$$
R_{\text{paid}} =
\sum_{i \in V} \hat P_i
+
\sum_{i \in V} \sum_j \hat P_{j,i}
$$

Unpaid rewards:

$$
R_{\text{unpaid}} = R - R_{\text{paid}}
$$

Unpaid rewards remain in the reward pool and are carried forward to the next reward period.
